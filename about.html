    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I love challenges and learning new things. That's why I decided to start studying python programming a couple of years 
  ago.  It's also the reason that rather than retiring at 65, I'm choosing to begin a whole new career instead! My only regret is 
    that I didn't find computer programming sooner.
    </p> 
  
    <p>I've always enjoyed linguistics and have been drawn to educational and creative 
  endeavors, like teaching and writing. Programming requires creativity and prproblem-solving, as well as utilizing language, 
  writing, and interpersonal skills. It also teaches and reinforces some valuable skills--not the least of which is patience!
